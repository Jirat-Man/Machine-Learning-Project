Load Data
Clean Data:
    replace 999 with NaN
    then drop all NaN because replacing them with mode decreases accuracy
    checked for duplicates, no duplicates found
    all data type are float, all good, no need to change categorical data to numerical

Outliers handling:
    use quantile ranges to detect outliers, then replace all the outliers with NaN
    replace all possible Nan with the mode 
    replace the rest of Nan with median
   
Feature Selection:
    Filter Feature using Correlation:
         Anything that has correlation score lower than 0.1 drop them
         do your own research on this
    
    Wrapper Method(Sequential Feature Selection Forward):
        do your own reseearch
    PCA:
        do you own research
    
Model Training and Evaluation:
    K-fold cross validation to evaluate all models
    I used many different models and feature selection combinations
    do you research on each model
    I am still in the process of finding the best model, tuning and finding problems
